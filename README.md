This Wordle Solver, was a really fun and unique holiday project. 

Halfway through the code, I found a website ranking wordle solvers.
I decided that I would not look at how anyone else had completed their solver until I had given mine a crack. 
Due to future projects, I am leaving my solver as is, sitting at **rank 270th**

The accuracy of the solver is ~99.52%, (2304/2315) 
(This number fluctuates between (2302/2315, due to the 6th guess last attempt sometimes being a guess.)
Wordle's solved in first guess: **7**
Wordle's solved in first two guesses: **159**
Wordle's solved in first three guesses: **668**
Wordle's solved in first four guesses: **1203**
Wordle's solved in five guesses: **226**
Wordle's solved in six guesses: **41**
Wordle's unsolvable: **11**
The average guess: **3.68**

This code is ready to be directly developed with a webscraper or grep tool, in order to run of the nytimes website. 
For now however, a word must be entered as the final word, and the computer will try and guess it. This just needs to be altered with the webscraper.

Guesses are as followed:
1. "comet"
2. "flash"
3. "brink"
4. "pudgy"
