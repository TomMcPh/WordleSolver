This Wordle Solver, was a really fun and unique holiday project. <br/> 

Halfway through the code, I found a website ranking wordle solvers. <br/> 
I decided that I would not look at how anyone else had completed their solver until I had given mine a crack. <br/> 
Due to future projects, I am leaving my solver as is, sitting at **rank 270th**<br/> 

The accuracy of the solver is ~99.52%, (2304/2315) <br/> 
(The correct guess number fluctuates between (2302-2315, due to the 6th guess last attempt sometimes being a guess.)<br/> 
Wordle's solved in first guess: **7**<br/> 
Wordle's solved in first two guesses: **159**<br/> 
Wordle's solved in first three guesses: **668**<br/> 
Wordle's solved in first four guesses: **1203**<br/> 
Wordle's solved in five guesses: **226**<br/> 
Wordle's solved in six guesses: **41**<br/> 
Wordle's unsolvable: **11**<br/> 
The average guess: **3.68**<br/> 

This code is ready to be directly developed with a webscraper or grep tool, in order to run off the nytimes website. <br/> 
For now however, a word must be entered as the final word, and the computer will try and guess it. This just needs to be altered with the webscraper.<br/> 

Guesses are as followed:<br/> 
1. "comet"<br/> 
2. "flash"<br/> 
3. "brink"<br/> 
4. "pudgy"<br/>
